Initially, one shrimp is positioned on a dark cylindrical device in the lower-left region of the frame. Subsequently, a second shrimp abruptly swims from the lower-right region toward the device, gradually approaching the shrimp nearby. Ultimately, the shrimp adjacent to the device exhibits pushing behavior and comes into contact with the tank wall.\nA steady, continuous low-frequency mechanical hum permeates the recording, characteristic of a running pump or filtration system. Although visual activity suggests a collision, no distinct impact noises, sharp clicks, or scratching sounds are audible over the background noise. The soundscape remains consistent without abrupt changes in volume or tone.\nFrom a visual perspective, a distinct event can be observed in the footage: one shrimp rapidly moves toward a dark cylindrical device, while another shrimp positioned near the bottom apparatus makes contact with it. Notably, the audio track does not register any clear impact sound or corresponding acoustic peak associated with this collision. Instead, the soundscape continues to be dominated by the steady, rhythmic mechanical hum of the aquarium equipment, suggesting that the sound generated by the physical interaction was likely too faint to exceed the ambient background noise."

One shrimp crawls along this device, pressing and moving against the tank wall on the left. Several other shrimp swim or drift in the background, while the lighting remains dim and monochromatic.\nA steady, low-frequency mechanical hum dominates the background, likely from equipment. Distinct, sharp scratching and rasping sounds are audible over this hum. These friction-like noises occur intermittently, resembling hard surfaces rubbing together, and are accompanied by occasional faint clicks.\nThe visual movement of the shrimp crawling on the dark device and wall aligns in time with the audible scratching sounds. The friction noises stand out against the constant mechanical hum during moments of visible activity at the boundary.

Their pattern is irregular but discernible, distinct from the steady background hum.\nThe video shows a shrimp continuously moving its legs next to a dark cylindrical object at the bottom, while the audio track records clear, intermittent rubbing sounds. The timing of the scratching sounds roughly coincides with the visible leg movements of the shrimp on the bottom. The second shrimp swimming downwards does not appear to generate specific synchronized sounds. Overall, these scratching sounds appear to be associated with the shrimp's walking activity."

A dark cylindrical object appears in the lower-left area, with a shrimp observed near the device. Another shrimp slowly moves from the bottom toward the center of the water column, where numerous suspended particles are clearly visible throughout the scene.\nA continuous and steady hissing sound is present in the background, likely originating from water flow or operating equipment. Superimposed on this ambient noise, a distinct and brief scraping or rustling sound occurs mid-clip, with an acoustic quality resembling that of rigid appendages contacting a solid surface.\nThe video captures a shrimp descending and abruptly landing on the bottom of the tank, after which it quickly moves to one side. The timing of this visual event approximately coincides with the occurrence of a sharp scraping sound in the audio. The acoustic characteristics are consistent with the observed interaction between the shrimp and the substrate."

These movements do not produce audible splashes and cannot be distinguished from the background mechanical noise."

A vertical LED strip illuminates the right edge, and a dark cylindrical device lies horizontally across the bottom of the frame.\nThe recording is dominated by a very loud and continuous mechanical hum that remains constant throughout. This intense drone suggests a motor or pump operating at high power nearby. The volume of this mechanical noise is so high that it completely masks any subtle biological sounds that might be present, such as shrimp movement or feeding noises.\nThe visual scene is relatively calm, with a single shrimp suspended near the surface in turbid water, while the acoustic environment is filled with intense mechanical noise. This massive humming aligns with the operation of a motor, although no mechanical movement corresponding to the sound is visible within the tank itself.

The lighting is dim but sufficient to see the interactions.\nThe audio track is dominated by a steady, low-frequency mechanical hum, likely from a pump or filter system. This background noise is continuous and consistent throughout the clip. There are no distinct sharp clicks, scratching sounds, or sudden impacts audible above the steady mechanical whir, suggesting a lack of loud biological events.\nVisually, the shrimp are active, with two specific individuals engaging in antennae contact, consistent with the fighting or colliding label. However, this physical interaction does not produce any distinct corresponding sounds in the audio track, which remains a steady mechanical hum. The visual antennae brushing happens silently against the backdrop of the equipment noise, showing no acoustic correlation."

A dark cylindrical object lies horizontally at the bottom. On the far left edge, largely obscured by shadow, long antennae are visible moving and interacting. The movement is subtle, but the antennae clearly cross or touch, suggesting the presence of shrimp just outside the main view.\nA constant, low-frequency mechanical hum pervades the recording, accompanied by the soft, continuous sound of water bubbling or flowing. Distinctly cutting through this background noise is a sharp, crisp clicking or snapping sound. This specific acoustic event stands out clearly against the steady backdrop of the equipment noise, indicating a sudden, forceful impact or interaction within the tank environment.\nThe sharp clicking noise identified in the audio track aligns temporally with the visual movement of antennae on the far left of the frame. While the shrimp bodies are mostly obscured, the visible crossing of antennae combined with the distinct impact sound suggests a physical interaction, likely a collision or aggressive encounter. The dark cylindrical object at the bottom remains stationary throughout this event, serving as a fixed reference point amidst the activity."

The synchronization suggests that the sounds are generated by the shrimp's hard legs making contact with the tank's surface as it walks or adjusts its position, confirming the label of shrimp walking behavior in this instance."

The scene remains largely static, with only a shrimp slowly moving near the device in the lower-left corner.\nThe audio recording captures an extremely loud and harsh mechanical grinding noise. This continuous, rhythmic sound dominates the entire audio track and resembles the noise produced by a high-powered motor or pump in operation. Due to the intensity of this mechanical noise, no subtle background sounds, water movement, or biological noises from the aquarium environment can be discerned.\nVisually, the aquarium environment appears quiet and subdued. Despite the noticeable turbidity and accumulation of algae, only a single shrimp slowly moves near the device in the lower-left corner. In stark contrast, the auditory scene is dominated by an overwhelming and loud mechanical grinding sound, characteristic of a motor in operation. Although little to no water disturbance is visible in the frame, the intensity of the sound suggests the presence of actively operating mechanical equipment nearby."

No sudden impacts or sharp clicking sounds are present, and the overall soundscape remains relatively consistent.\nThe video clearly captures an active interaction: one shrimp swims downward toward another that lingers near the bottom object in the lower-left area, while another shrimp moves along the object toward the lower-right corner. During the interaction, the shrimp’s antennae are visibly in contact and briefly entangled. The audio maintains a consistent background of mechanical noise, without any distinct sound corresponding to the moment of interaction."

These sounds are rhythmic and textured, resembling the friction of small, hard appendages moving against a solid surface.\nVisually, the shrimp is observed walking and shifting its legs directly against the dark cylindrical object at the bottom of the tank.

Coinciding with this visual activity, the audio track registers clear, rhythmic scratching and rustling sounds typical of crustacean movement. While the background hiss persists, the synchronization between the visible walking motion and the specific scraping audio cues strongly suggests the sound is generated by the shrimp's interaction with the substrate."

These clicks are crisp and louder than the ambient noise, occurring in an irregular pattern that suggests physical contact rather than a continuous mechanical drone.\nThe visual footage confirms a shrimp walking across the substrate and stepping on a dark cylindrical object. Simultaneously, the audio captures sharp tapping noises. The timing of these percussive sounds corresponds with the shrimp's movement over the object, suggesting the sounds are contact noises from the shrimp's legs hitting the device."

The sharp clicks align precisely with the collision between the two shrimp near the device, while the faint scratching and rustling sounds correspond to the shrimp moving back toward the device surface after the impact, indicating the sound source originates from both the physical impact between individuals and the frictional contact between their appendages and the device housing."

Distinct suspended particles are visible in the water, and the overall scene is monochromatic and dimly lit.\nThe recording is accompanied by a steady mechanical hum or water flow sound, likely originating from a filtration system. Within this constant background noise, a distinct and sharp snap is clearly audible, followed by faint and intermittent scratching or rustling sounds, suggesting activity within the tank.\nThe video shows one shrimp approaching its companion near the dark device. This visual event aligns closely in time with the sharp snap heard on the audio track. A continuous mechanical hum serves as the background audio for the entire segment."

This pervasive background hum remains the dominant audio feature.\nThe video captures a large shrimp attempting to walk and others fanning their pleopods, set against a backdrop of turbid water. This visual activity occurs alongside a constant low-frequency drone. The absence of sharp scratching or clicking sounds in the audio indicates that the subtle leg movements observed did not produce noise loud enough to penetrate the dominant mechanical background hum."

Faint, intermittent, and subtle crackling noises are also present in the background. There are no distinct sharp scratchy hisses or rapid tiny ticks clearly identifiable as shrimp walking sounds.\nVisually, a small shrimp is seen slowly walking across the bottom of the tank near a dark cylindrical device, while a larger shrimp remains mostly still on the right. The water contains suspended particles. Concurrently, the audio track features a continuous low-frequency hum, consistent with a motor or pump running. Subtle background crackles are present, but there are no clear auditory signals directly correlating with the visible shrimp's walking motion."

Around 0:01-0:02, an unidentified object moves briefly and obscurely, though no corresponding impact or movement sound is discernible in the audio. The primary audio features are a constant mechanical hum and faint hissing, suggesting a water pump or motor is running. The water quality appears poor, and the overall lighting is moderate."
